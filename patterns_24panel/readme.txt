Temperature Rig Patterns:

1: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high light bar on dark background using Anmo's grayscale 3 
2: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high light bar on dark background using Anmo's grayscale 2 
3: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high light bar on dark background using Anmo's grayscale 1 

4: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high dark bar on light background using Anmo's grayscale 3 
5: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high dark bar on light background using Anmo's grayscale 2 
6: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high dark bar on light background using Anmo's grayscale 1 

7: 4 LED width, 4 Panel high light bar on 1 background using Anmo's grayscale 3 

8: all on
9: all off


10: Just as pattern6 but with no row compression (but 6 pixel instead of 4)
11: Just as pattern3 but with no row compression (but 6 pixel instead of 4)

12: Wierd pattern Anmo gs1
13: light bar 6 pixel (like 11) but starts to left of fly
14: boxes with different cecnter of gravity 180 degrees apart
15: light bar 10 pixel (like 11) but starts to right of fly

16: light bar 6 pixel (like 11) but horizontal
17: horizontal bar starts in front, vertical bar behind

18: Anmo's 1/f
19-23: Anmo's 1/f at various heights in arena (1 panel)
24-27: Anmo's 1/f at various heights in arena (2 panel)

28-37: same as 18-27 but for a 6 pixel on, 6 pixel of gs1 grating
There are some inconsistencies in the above pattern set because
nGraylevel was swithed from 2 to 8 in the middle of the code. The actual
grating is at gs1 but the patternxnum and number of patterns in Pat do not match

38: T and inverted T using the top the rows of display
39: dark 6 pixel bar in otherwise light background

100: P Weir's translational optic flow, density 15, gs 1, light blobs dark bg
101: P Weir's translational optic flow, density 15, gs 1, dark blobs light bg
102: P Weir's translational optic flow, density 5, gs 1, light blobs dark bg
103: P Weir's translational optic flow, density 5, gs 1, dark blobs light bg
